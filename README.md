# PHP

Objectives
● Get experience with the PHP programming language.
● Get experience with the Facebook Graph API.
● Get experience with the Google Geocoding API.
● Get experience with the JSON parsers in PHP.

In this I create a webpage that allows you to search for information about a set of Facebook entities (i.e., users, pages, events, places, and groups) using the Facebook Graph API, and the results will be displayed in a tabular format.
A user first opens the web page where he/she can enter a keyword and choose an entity type (i.e., users, pages, events, places and groups) from a drop-down list.
